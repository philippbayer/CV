# About

My CV using the R-package vitae. This folder contains the RStudio-project, and (so far) two CV-versions, a long one, and one shorter than two pages. I need a one-pager, too.

There's an older, pure LaTeX-based version in Old_CV/. This does not compile on newer (>20) Ubuntu systems because the style is very outdated.
